---

In this tutorial, we will create a simple, real and single page Appointment Booking web application using Javascript Fullstack or MEAN Stack (MongoDB + Express + AngualrJS + NodeJS) which can also be used as an Event Scheduler.

- The Javascript fullstack will have both Client and Server architecture and will share the same JSON (Javascript Simple Object Notation) format across Client, Server and Database.
- The code will be fast, modular and less redundant.
- We will integrate Google Material Design guidelines into our code for a better UI experience.
- We will use document based no-sql database named MongoDB
