Sometime before I created an appointment booking app using AngularJS and it was huge popular amoung my readers. So I decided to re-create the same using the microservice architecture

## Features

- This reduces hosting cost
- Easy to deploy
- Superfast
- No architecture to maintain
- No softwares to install

<a href="https://appointment.itswadesh.now.sh/" class="button green" target="_blank">Live Demo</a> 
<div class="github">
    <a href="https://github.com/itswadesh/simple-appointment" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">
        <b>Simple Appointment Booking - NodeJS</b>Download this project form Github
    </a>
</div>

This time we will use MLab for MongoDB (a self hosted mongodb database as service)

## Start
1. Download now-cli `npm i -g now`
2. Clone or Download the project from github. Then just run the command `now`

Everything else will be taken care and you must see a url returned by now-cli and your app is live

## Now
Now is the service which will host our microservice. Inside now.json we define all the instructions to setup our microservice at Now server
```
{
  "name": "appointment",
  "version": 2,
  "env": {
    "MONGODB_URI": "@appointment"
  },
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "www/**",
      "use": "@now/static"
    },
    {
      "src": "api/**/*.js",
      "use": "@now/node"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/",
      "dest": "www/index.html"
    },
    {
      "src": "/app.js",
      "dest": "www/app.js"
    },
    {
      "src": "/css/(.*)",
      "dest": "/www/css/$1"
    },
    {
      "src": "/js/(.*)",
      "dest": "/www/js/$1"
    },
    {
      "src": "/app/(.*)",
      "dest": "/www/app/$1"
    },
    {
      "src": "/images/(.*)",
      "dest": "/www/images/$1"
    },
    {
      "src": "/api",
      "dest": "api/*"
    }
  ]
}
```
