     there. Try to get your post featured at Technorati tag pages by tagging
     your posts with relevant tags. Technorati tag pages rank well in Yahoo and

<br /></div>
<h3 class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;">
Content Optimization</h3>
<ol start="11" style="margin-top: 0in;" type="1">
<li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in;">Content
     is the King. If you post useful articles, it will definitely increase your
     website ranking.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in;">Check
     your blog stats and write around the keywords that are working for you.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in;">Keep
     your content short and simple. People are more attracted towards it.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in;">Try to
     interlink your blog posts. So that if any other site is scrapping your
     blog’s feed, it will give you an inbound link easily.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in;">Add
     search description to each post (if using blogger), but restrict it to 150
     characters.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in;">Do not
     copy any content from any other websites. Search Engines gives those
     articles a Thumbs Down. If some one files a DMCA (Digital Millennium
     Copyright Act) complaint, Google won’t index your website further. So
     always try to avoid it and post original contents.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in;">Always
     put some effort to minimize grammatical error so that your blog looks
     professional.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in;">Create
     and release a free plugin for bloging platforms, firefox or any other
     website.</li>

     a list of best posts of other blogger’s. If it impress that blogger, it
     will give you a free and relevant backlink.</li>

     interview successful people in your niche. It normally attracts more
     visitors as well as creates a great brand image and social circle.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in;">Create
     and release some wordpress or blogger templates. Don’t forget the
     “Designed by YOUR SITE at the
     footer.” </li>
<li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in;">Add a
     related post widget at the bottom of the blog. It keep your users engaged
     and hence slowly creates your brand name. The best example is mgid.com.
     Such a widget named linked within is available free for both Blogger and
     Wordpress</li>
<li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in;">Build
     a 101 list. People can’t resist linking to it. Put the original authors
     link at the end of every entry to your list. When they find that you are
     linking to them, probably the will also linking to you. This way even you
     preserves the Law of Copyright. </li>

     a list of the top 10+ myths for a specific category.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in;">Create

     properly or find a way to make your list look popular, the gurus may end
     up linking to your blog too saying thanks or commenting.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in;">Track
     who picks up your articles or press releases. Offer them exclusive news or
     content.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in;">Search
     for ’your industry’ + ‘in the news’ at google and link to it + write about
     it.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in;">Perform
     surveys and studies that make people feel important. If you make someone
     else feel important, they will do free marketing for you. A Win-Win
     situation.</li>

     to similar blogs like yours. So that a part of traffic from the other blog
     flows to you too.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in;">Review
     related sites on Alexa.com. Reviews always attract traffic and have a
     pretty good SEO value.</li>

     products and services on shopping search engines like ePinions. Normally

     have a space in your blog for sponsorship. Support charity by sponsoring
     them. Charity websites have higher page rank. Most charities, conferences,
     contests link to their sponsors. If they link to you, your page rank
     increases making it more visible to search engines. This can be a great
     way to link building, ranking, getting links and visibility as well as a
     good feeling as you are supporting charity.</li>
